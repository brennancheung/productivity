# Personal Productivity App

This is a personal project designed with multiple goals in mind:

* Provide a larger project context that allows me to experiment 
with technologies like Kubernetes, Rust, microservices, etc.

* Create a custom implementation of personal productivity 
practices that I have found to work for me.

* Provide Kubernetes workloads that can be used to verify
a Kubernetes cluster is working.
